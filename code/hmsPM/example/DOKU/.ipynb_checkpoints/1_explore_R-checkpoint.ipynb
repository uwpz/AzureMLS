    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebook gives an example how we do **EDA (explorative data analysis)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the first one in a series of 5 notebooks. The next 2 notebooks load the results of this notebook and implement model comparison and model interpretation respectively.  The last 2 notebooks show how to implement model training in production, as well as scoring for new data, which closes the loop of all codings you need to implement for a predictive modeling project.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a better understanding you should have **basic knowledge of predictive modelling**, i.e. know what a logistic regression is and the meaning of tuning and cross-validation, for instance. If you still have problems with some terms you can easily google appropriate information.\n",
    "\n",
    "As example data source the well known **titanic data set** is chosen (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It is therefore a classification problem with the binary target *survived/not survived*. Even though you cannot compare the titanic case with a real life setting, the following steps pretty much reflect (on a small scale!) how we conduct data analysis in all our predictive modeling projects."

    "In real life you usually have lots of input variables (features), which might be created in parallel to your data analysis implementation but on database side by a data engineer. Then it makes sense to administer the definition of the features together with some metadata (implementation status like \"under construction\" or \"ready\", typical values, comments regarding derivation, etc.) in an external tool. For a pragmatic approach an excel sheet nicely fits the requirement and can be automatically read by your program. E.g you could directly check the consistency of this datamodel.xls with the current data you load like it is done in the following. Below you see an example of such an excel sheet which we further filter on the variables we will use in our model."

In case of infinite data, an algorithm like deep neural nets is capable of finding all relations the features have with the target. But you will never have infinite data ... even in times of big data!\n",

In such cases it is often advantagous that most of the feature engineering is done on database side where the data originates.  \n",

    "## 2.3 Plot the finalized features\n",
    "We are now ready to get the final distribution plot for the metric features. This plot has several characteristics helping to judge the features:  \n",
    "+ We also print the **univariate variable importance**, which, for a classification problem, is identical with the **in-sample (or \"training\") AUC** (area under the curve) you can achieve if you solely use one feature to predict the target. \n",
    "+ Before calculating it, we **impute the missing values with random non-missing values** from the same variable which assures that the univariate variable importance is not overly optimistic due to a restriction to the non-missing variable values. Actually also the opposite, i.e. only calculate the variable importance on the non-missing values of the feature, might comprise releveant information, e.g. hint to data leakage (see explanation below)\n",
    "+ But we add the percentage of (imputed) missings to better justify the importance of the feature. \n",
    "+ The **stratification by the target** helps to identify the effect on the target.\n",
    "+ The boxplots below the distributions supports in **identifying outliers** and in **comparison of the mean** (marked by the cross) and the median (marked by the bar) of the feature in the two target strata.\n",
    "+ We additionally plot the effect of the binned versions of the features which sometimes is advantageous in visualizing the effect on the target (with the **dotted line showing the base ratio of the target**, i.e. 38% survival rate). E.g. if you have a metric variable with lots of data in a small range, this plot pulls apart possible effects. Do not get confused by the unequal percentage of observations for each bin which is printed in brackets behind the bin edges; this can occur in case of too few distinct values of the original variable. \n",
    "+ The binned version plot also helps in **identifying informative missings** by comparing the effect of the \"(Missing)\" bin with the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially the next to last bullet is important. If you already see here an effect which is **\"too good to be true\"**, you might have created some form of ***data leakage***. This isssue always occurs if you have some data relations in your training data that would not occur in a similar way for your future test data and therefore would result in a much lesser predictive performance for the latter. The data leakage can have several reasons: you might have incorporated **\"self-predictors\" or \"information from the future\"** as explained in more detail below. In such a case you need to fix the leakage, e.g. by removing the self-predictors from your feature vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to emphasize at this point that we never use the analysis of the following plot to remove any metric features due to a lack of predictability for the target. Such an approach for filtering out features by utilizing all data (and therefore also the test data) is called **\"data snooping\"** and should be avoided at all costs as it prevents you from estimating the correct predictive capability of your data. We will let the robust machine learning algorithm decide whether and how to use all features."

    "The following findings can be derived from the plots:\n",
    "+ We see that children have a higher probability to survive. \n",
    "+ Apart from that, the **lower survial rate in case of a missing age** (see the binned age plot) pops up. Even though this effect is not huge it hints to a possible data leakage, i.e. that age was recorded after the accident with a \"higher probability of response\" due to survival of the passenger. This example for \"information from the future\" nicely corresponds to typical business data situations where special data flags are set after the event of interest and are therefore useless for predicting the future. We emphasize this issue again as it is **one of the biggest problems in real life predictive models!** Actually for the titanic data an alternative explanation can be that 3rd class passengers which have a lower survival rate (see the forthcoming analysis) have not reported their age. If this is the case you can keep the feature.   \n",
    "+ This informative missing is also the reason for a higher variable importance of *age\\_BINNED\\_* compared to *age*, as the former comprises the informative missing as own level, but for the latter it is randomly imputed.\n",
    "+ Furthermore we can identify that ***fare*** is highly predictable for the target (AUC: 0.67) which is due to a nearly linear trend. Keep in mind that this is still a **univariate influence** and might change if we adjust for the other features in the final multivarite model. E.g. the *fare* effect might be ***confounded*** by the passenger class which might be the causal reason behind this effect as first class passengers (which pay a higher fare) are nearer to the top deck and due to this reason had a higher chance to survive.  \n",

    "## 2.4 Correlation analysis\n",
    "Now we investigate the relation between the metric features themselves by a correlation analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When using **classical regression approaches** (without any regularization by penalization) this would be a very important step as highly correlated covariates would lead to the so-called **multicollinearity** problem. As a consequence the estimates of the model parameters (i.e. the beta coefficients in the model equation) would be highly instable and the predicctive performance of the model would decrease drastically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In times of robust machine learning algorithms which can handle this issue, we use the correlation analysis mostly to **identify \"duplicates\" of variables**, which can be removed without any loss. It is not unusual that under a high amount of metric features you find several which measure the same thing, e.g. revenue-per-month and revenue-per-year, which would pop up in a correlation matrix plot.  \n",
    "In such a case we remove the variable which has more missings. Therefore we directly plot the missing rate for each variable beside the variable name. Alternatively you can remove the feature which has less variance and therefore comprises less self-contained information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Futhermore we only **plot the correlations above a cutoff value** in order to keep the plot manageable in case of many metric variables. Often we choose .97, but then only consider **correlations above .99 for the \"duplicate\" candidates**. For the small titanic data none of these advices are relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We almost always plot the **absolute Spearman correlation**, which is based on the ranks of the variable values and is more robust against outliers than the better known Pearson correlation. Since we took care about outliers by previous steps this might not be needed, but furthermore the Spearman correlation can also better **identify non-linear (but monotone) correlations**. And we take the absolute value as for our purpose it does not make a difference if the correlation is negative or positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least this analysis also helps to understand the data in hand."

    "We need to check whether the **data distributions are different between the train and test data**. Usually this occurs (in case of a timely based train/test split) due to a time dependency of the features. For typical business data this hints to a change in some process, related to business (e.g. \"opened more stores in some regions\") or data (e.g. \"flag *xyz* now underlies a different definition\"). If it occurs, it is bad news as it might degrade your predictive performance on test data and you need to decide how to handle this feature distribution change: restrict to just newer data in training or remove the time-dependant feature or add a \"process-has-changed-here\"-flag? There is no default solution here. You need to decide case-by-case.\n",

    " In this section we do a similar analysis for the **categorical (nominal) features**. But due to the different scale, the handling of several issues are approached differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all you need to decide which ones are the categorical features. At least all variables containing any characters must be treated as nominal. But also 0/1-flags are added. Futhermore numerically coded variables where the single value has \"no meaning\", i.e. you cannot do any calculations with them, like for german postal codes. And it is **not unusual to also treat some clear numeric variables as categorical** in case they comprise just a small number of distinct values, e.g. a month (ranging from 1-12) or day-of-week (ranging from 1-7); in fact these are treated as ordinal as they can be sorted in a senseful way. At least the explorative plots you will see later can visualize data relations better when these kind of variables are treated as categorical. It usually also helps an elastic-net algorithm in order to model the realationship to the target in a nonlinear way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In case we finally decide for a **tree-based algorithm** we might switch back to the metric scale again because it would save memory (as explained in the following) and nonlinear modeling can then be accomplished also with a clear metric feature. This is already a hint that **data preprocessing in the final productive model can be different from the explorative phase**. We usually address this by the 2 attributes \"explore_type\" and \"model_type\" in our metadata (not reflected in this notebook), which can differ for some variables in the way that *explore_type = nominal* might have a different *model_type = metric* (but not vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "For now this means that we also add the missing indicators (0/1-flags) to the nominal feature vector and create a quick overview."

    "## 3.1 Handling of missings and too-many-members features\n",
    "Feeding categorical features into **non-tree-based** machine learning algorithms requires a so-called **\"1-hot\" (or \"dummy\") coding** for the features. This means you need to create a binary flag variable for each level of a categorical variable. For each data record only one of these flags has the value 1, all others are 0 (-> \"1-hot\").  \n",
    "Even **most implementations of tree-based algorithms (e.g. xgboost)** need pure metric features and therefore 1-hot coded nominal variables or at least numeric variables which are differently \"encoded\" (as explained in more detail below). \n",
    "\n",
    "Apparently 1-hot coding results in **one colum per each member of a categorical variable**. In real life situations with more data than in the titanic case you need special forms of encoding (see explanations below9 of these variables with lots of members if you do not want to **run into memory space limitations**.  \n",
    "This is done in one of the next code snippets: We decide to **collapse the less frequent occuring levels** to a new artficial level \"\\_OTHER\\_\" and only the top-n (with n=10 for the titanic data) members per feature are kept as is. This threshold (*topn_toomany = 10*) is somewhat arbitrary here and will be different for other data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a **tree-based** algorithm there are additional other approaches to cope with too-many-member features which utilize special **encodings** (= numerical representations or mappings) as a **tree-based algorithm** is in principle also capable of handling any nominal feature as one and only one pure metric variable which apparently comprises much less space than the 1-hot coded variant. There are basically 3 variants of this \"encoding into 1 numeric feature\".\n",
    "1. **Label encoding**: Just map the members to an arbitrary number, e.g. \"level-1\"->1,\"level-2\"->2, ...\n",
    "2. **Count encoding**: First order the levels by their occurence and the map to a consecutive numer, e.g. if \"level-k\" comprises most records it is mapped to 1, the second most occurring level is mapped to 2 and so on. This keeps \"big\" members together and might help to find the signal (in case the signal is low for every member, the neighbourhood of big members helps in splitting of the few relevant, i.e. \"big\" ones)\n",
    "3. **Target encoding**: In fact the Count encoding ordering is not doing a good job in supporting the extraction of the signel (i.e. the effect on the target). It makes more sense to respect the average target value of the members. This is done with the *Target encoding* by arranging with regard to the average target value before assigning consecutive numbers. **ATTENTION**: We use the target for this mapping. Therefore we need to do this on a subset of the data and then remove this subset as otherwise we create **data leakage**. But if you have e.g. lots of years of data you can use the old data for the encoding and leave the more actual data for the training of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it more complicated: A tree-based algorithm might also profit from a 1-hot encoding as this makes a possible signal sharper. Think of the signal is \"in the middle or the numeric representation\", i.e. the target has a high or low value for a middle value of the encoded feature: with 1-hot coding it can be extracted by 1 split, but using consecutive numeric values for this variable needs two splits to extract the signal. Therefore additionally to the numerical encoding of a feature with lots of levels we 1-hot encode the top-n occurring levels (and also add the artificial \"\\_OTHER\\_\" level). And for the numerical encoding we adapt the standard count encoding in a way that we only count-encode the **non-top-n members** and map the top-n members to just one value. In other words: The 1-hot coding comprises the top-n members and the count-encoding the non-top-n. This assures that we keep as much information as possible without doubling it and help the algorithm to find the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that for **any non-tree based algorithm we are stuck to the nominal scale and 1-hot encoding!** For the deep learning guys outside there who now protest: We do not encounter any numerical embedding approaches here. To summarise again: For Tree-based algorithms we use count encoding of the non-top-n members additional to 1-hot-encoding of top-n members, for non-Tree-based we just provide the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1-hot coding is postponed to the application of the machine learning algorithm since an automatic support for this transformation is available there. For now we conduct the collapsing to the most frequent levels as well as the additional numerical encoding.\n",
    "As as first step we just copy the too-many-members features as these are treated in two different ways (as explained above) in the following, i.e. collapsing of levels and additional encoding.\n"

    "Lots of interesting findings can be derived from the plots. We just list some of them:\n",
    "+ Passenger Class (*pclass*) and *sex* have a high impact on survival rate: Lucky Rose, sorry Jack ....\n",
    "+ We see some extreme effects for *sibsp* and *parch*, i.e. zero or at least low survival rate for the members with a high value. Actually these correspond to very rare members and therefore **do not represent a real signal!**\n",
    "+ *deck* and *home.dest\\_OTHER\\_* have **informative missings** as the probability of survival is highly reduced. Similarly to the missing age effect it is questionable whether this is not some form of data leakage (see explanations for age in chapter 2). Btw, the missing age effect can also be seen in the plot of the **missing indicator** of age (*MISS_age*).\n",
    "+ But the most extreme effect occurs for *boat_OTHER_*. It seems like a perfect predictor for survival. Actually if you check what this variable means, you notice that it denotes the lifeboat and is therefore clearly **information from the future**. A passenger first must have survived before the number of the lifeboat which catched him/her is known. We need to remove this variable form the predictor (feature) set. Again we need to emphasize here, that in case you see in these plots an effect which seems to be too good to be true, all your alarm rings should start. And always be aware that this issue can come along in more subtle ways than for this easy identifiable example!"

    "## 3.3 Correlation analysis\n",
    "We have reached the investigation of **dependencies between the nominal features**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically we use a similar approach to the correlation analysis for the metric variables, with the absolute Spearman correlation exchanged by the ***(corrected) contingency coefficient***. This metric also varies between 0 and 1 with 0 denoting absolute independency and 1 absolute dependency between the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "And like for the metric features we also only remove the ones which show a really high \"correlation\", **BUT only if the number of levels between the \"correlated\" features do NOT highly differ**. In turn this means that we keep 2 features which are highly dependant (maybe also perfectly depdendant, i.e. with a contingency coefficient equals 1), like it would happen for typical \"product groups\" and \"product types\" for instance, as one of these variables is a grouping of the other and helps the algorithm to find the signal (if it is there). But if both features comprise nearly the same number of levels we can remove one of them without any loss as both are features are kind of equal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the titanic data we only see a high dependency for the missing indicator of fare\\_LOG\\_ and fare_pp as both represent the same information and we remove one of them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that we also only plot variables which have at least one \"correlation\" above the **cutoff**. In such a case the metric is printed in white. And variables with high dependencies are clustered together. Both helps to get the overview quicker in case of a high amount of nominal features. "
